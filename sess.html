<p align="justify">Snooker, popular billiards game of British origin, played on a table similar in size and markings to that used in English billiards. The game arose, presumably in India, as a game for soldiers in the 1870s. The game is played with 22 balls, made up of one white ball (the cue ball); 15 red balls, valued at 1 point each; one yellow, 2 points; one green, 3; one brown, 4; one blue, 5; one pink, 6; and one black, 7. Players try to pocket first the red and then the nonred balls, scoring one point for each red and the number value of the others.

        billiards: Snooker
        Snooker is played on the same table and with the same size balls used for English billiards. The game is played with 22…
        To begin, the balls are arranged as follows: all reds in a pyramid with its apex on the pyramid spot; black on the billiard spot near the foot of the table; pink touching the apex of the pyramid; blue at the centre spot; and green, brown, and yellow at the left, centre, and right of the straight line of the D, a semicircular area at the head of the table.
        
        The first (break) shot must contact a red ball initially.<div><img src="cool.png" height=200 width=300> </div>A player shoots until he fails to pocket a ball or fouls, then yields play to an opponent. When playing at a nonred ball, the player must designate which ball is “on” (his target), although he need not specify where he intends to pocket the ball. Red balls remain pocketed, whether played legally or not, but the others are immediately replaced on their respective spots as long as any reds remain on the table. When all reds are pocketed, players attempt to pocket the other balls in numerical order. When the last ball is off the table, the game ends and the player with the highest score wins.
        
        Penalties are assessed for fouls, i.e., violations of certain rules, including pocketing the cue ball </p>
